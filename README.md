# Tracking a Lacrosse Ball in Gametime Video
By Austin Huang

## Overview
Lacrosse is a fast growing sport in America. To facilitate sustained growth, there needs to be a healthy audience, which means spectators must be able to understand the game when they watch.
One of the hardest factors that prevent an audience from understanding the game is the inability to locate the lacrosse ball, a ball the size of the tennis ball that is usually passed or shot at speeds of over 90 mph.
My project aims to locate and track a lacrosse ball in a given video, whether it be the ball in the air or hidden within a playere's stick.

## Requirements
To use my code, you will need:
- python
- numpy
- openCV

## Installation Instructions
To run my code, you will need to:
- have video of a lacrosse game. (Right now use the sample I provide)
- download one or more of the source code files in my repo, they all work but at different speeds and accuracies. 
I recommend optical_flow.0.py

## Run Instructions
To run, run through terminal or a python environment (I used pyCharm). It will prompt you for the full filepath  to a lacrosse game video 
(i.e. */C:/Users/austi/PycharmProjects/LacrosseBallTracking/ncaa_2019_semifinals_maryland_vs_virginia.mp4*)
